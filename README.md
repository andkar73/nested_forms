# NestedForms
The purpose of project is to test how to build nested forms. 
This project is built according to the instructions in the tutorial "The Complete Guide to Nested Forms in Phoenix".

I have modified the example so it work with Phoenix 1.4.

To start your Phoenix server:
----------------------------

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Add your database credentials to `config/dev.exs`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
